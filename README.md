## Overview

![screenshot](404-site.jpg)


- Where can I see your demo?

Right [here](https://coldfix.dev/error-page.html)

- What was your experience?

I had a hard time finding the fonts used. Font Squirrel helped me find the font of the main text body.
However, I had to give up on the font of the '404 NOT FOUND' header since the letters were scrunched up
together. According to Font Squirrel, there is a way to separate letters scrunched up together, but I'm
too lazy to figure out how.


- What have you learned/improved?

I improved my knowledge of CSS grid and media queries.

- Your wisdom? :)

It might be a good idea to learn OpenCV/Gimp so that one can identify contours around the letters and separate them
for FontSquirrel.

### Built With

Just humble vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. 
The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an simple 404 page that would
change its layout according to screen size.
